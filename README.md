# Vgram
My first approach to build a social website. Vgram is a website developed for sharing pictures and to review them. Here one can post the pictures, comment and like them. The user interface is all based on my experience with the previous web development skills. Technologies used are JavaScript, HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap, NodeJS, Express, Moment, Passport, MongoDB and Heroku.
If got new ideas and want to improve the site, you are welcome!
